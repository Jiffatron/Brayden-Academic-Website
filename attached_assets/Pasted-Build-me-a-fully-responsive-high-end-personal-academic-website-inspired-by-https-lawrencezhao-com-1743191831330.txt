Build me a fully responsive, high-end personal academic website inspired by https://lawrencezhao.com/, but with an extremely unique, luxury-grade UI and modern web design aesthetics. The site should feel like it cost over $10,000 to design and develop. Prioritize elegance, clarity, performance, and minimalism.

üîπ Site Overview:
This is a personal academic site for a professor or PhD-level researcher in finance or quantitative economics.

The layout should follow a single-page scroll OR separate pages, depending on what suits a clean UX.

Avoid templates that look generic ‚Äî I want subtle animations, custom typography, and artistic balance in layout.

üîπ Required Sections (Matching Lawrence Zhao's content):
Header / Hero

Professional headshot (use placeholder).

Name: Brayden Judge

Title: Undergraduate Student | Finance | Texas Tech University

Subtext: Short mission line ‚Äî "Exploring the quantitative backbone of markets and decision-making."

Include minimalist navbar linking to: About / Research / Resume / Blog / Contact.

Consider a parallax effect or slight hero animation on scroll.

About

Bio with professional tone but personable.

Example: "I'm a senior undergraduate student in finance at Texas Tech University. My interests include financial modeling, public and private sector investment analysis, and the intersection of AI and market behavior."

Include a sharp portrait photo (placeholder OK).

Research / Projects

Section for describing major projects, including:

Equity research (e.g., Boeing)

Financial statement analysis (e.g., Municipal Advisory Council internship)

Academic interests like Efficient Market Hypothesis, interest rate risk, and public finance

Styled like journal entries or elegant cards, with hover animations and expandable text.

Resume / CV

Button to download PDF resume

Also embed resume content into the page, styled in a clean, readable format with sections: Education, Experience, Skills, Certifications.

Blog

Simple, clean blog feed layout for future posts

Each post has a bold title, date, short preview, and elegant "Read More" link.

Contact

Professional contact form: Name / Email / Message

Email address shown: brayden.judge@email.com (or placeholder)

Minimalist social icons (LinkedIn, GitHub)

üé® Design Style:
Use a dark theme or ultra-clean light theme with unique color palette (deep navy + electric cyan OR ivory white + muted earth tones).

Ultra-smooth UI/UX: section transitions, subtle motion, floating nav bar.

Custom typography ‚Äî pair one serif (e.g., Playfair Display) with a geometric sans-serif (e.g., DM Sans, Inter).

Soft shadows, glassmorphism, or tasteful gradients OK if subtle.

Responsive and pixel-perfect on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

üîç Technical Considerations:
Fully responsive

Clean semantic HTML and accessible markup

Fast loading speed with image optimization and compressed CSS/JS

SEO-optimized for academic/professional name queries

Optional: light/dark mode toggle

üß† Tone of Voice:
Intelligent, clean, approachable, modern

Avoid fluff, focus on content that demonstrates thought leadership and depth
